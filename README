Welcome to DELORES, a defeasible logic reasoning system.

DELORES is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.

The doc subdirectory contains a Unix man page describing how to use
DELORES.  There is also a LaTeX file (preprocessed into DVI and PDF
formats) which contains a programmer's guide for those wishing to
understand or extend DELORES.  Only the man page is installed by
default.

For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL
file.
