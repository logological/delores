Bugs, limitations, and known issues for DELORES.

BUGS:
    * `include()' statements must be on separate lines

LIMITATIONS:
    * primes.txt is complete only for primes <= 1299827
    * code for real-time timers is compiler-specific; see timer.h for
      details.  If your compiler is not supported, all real-time timers
      remain at time 0.

UNRESOLVED IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES:
    * how to handle redefinition of rules
    * format for fprint[Rule|Atom] -- use `~' or `neg' in output?
    * how to check state of constants
