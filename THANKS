DELORES was originally conceived by Michael Maher <mjm@math.luc.edu>
and implemented by Tristan Miller <psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>.

Many people have further contributed to DELORES by reporting problems,
suggesting various improvements, or submitting actual code. Here is a
list of these people. Help me keep it complete and exempt of errors.

Much of the research behind DELORES was performed while the authors
were employed by Griffith University.

We thank Scott Brady and Chris Herring for their work on a preliminary
all-conclusions system.

We thank Guido Governatori for his work on the transformations used in
DELORES and for discussions on defeasible logic.

Development of DELORES was supported by the Australian Research
Council under grant A49803544.
