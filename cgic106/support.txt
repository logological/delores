Support for CGIC

    Are you getting a "server error," indicating that your web server
    "cannot allow POST to this URL," or a similar message? YOU MUST
    CONFIGURE YOUR WEB SERVER TO ALLOW CGI PROGRAMS, AND YOU MUST
    INSTALL CGI PROGRAMS IN THE LOCATION (OR WITH THE EXTENSION) THAT
    YOUR WEB SERVER EXPECTS TO SEE. Please don't send me email about
    this. It is strictly between you and your web server's documentation,
    or between you and your ISP. Thanks!

 
Anyone can mail questions about the gd and cgic libraries to 
boutell@boutell.com. However, I receive a very large volume of email on 
many subjects, and while I do my best to respond to all queries this can 
take some time. Sometimes the response must take the form of an eventual 
new release or an addition to a FAQ or other document, as opposed to an 
detailed individual response.

The old "priority support" offer for CGIC has been discontinued,
due to the impracticality of billing for it.
