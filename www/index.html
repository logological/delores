    <h1>DELORES &mdash; Defeasible Logic Reasoning System</h1>

    <p>DELORES (DEfeasible LOgic REasoning System) is a
    forward-chaining reasoning engine for defeasible logic, a
    less-expressive but more efficient non-monotonic logic. In
    contrast with most other non-monotonic logics, defeasible logic
    has linear complexity, allowing DELORES to execute large theories
    very quickly. DELORES's algorithm extends to general defeasible
    theories through the use of a pre-processing transformation which
    eliminates all uses of defeaters and superiority relations. The
    transformation was designed to provide incremental transformation
    of defeasible theories, and systematically uses new atoms and new
    defeasible rules to simulate the eliminated features.</p>
